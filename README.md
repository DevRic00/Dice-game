Dice Game Description

This simple dice game is designed for two players who take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. Players can roll values between 0 and 6. If a player rolls a 0, they lose all points accumulated in that turn and must pass the die to the next player. The objective is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Players can also choose to "hold" their points at any time, securing their current turn's points to their total score and passing the die to the other player. The first player to reach exactly 100 points wins the game.
